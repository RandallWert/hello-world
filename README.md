# hello-world
My first repository, created primarily to learn this feature of GitHub. 
I have heard a lot about GitHub and am here to learn how to use it effectively. I began programming in 1987 and have used a variety of languages. In recent years, I have coded mostly in JavaScript. Currently I am most interested in improving my skills in Python (my favorite language).
I have also taught AP Computer Science and five levels of German at a high school in Pennsylvania.
